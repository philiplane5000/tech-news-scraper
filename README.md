# NEWS SCRAPER

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

* Comment delete button should delete that comment (missing route)

* Final Article page without image and the div is not responsive

* `Clean Slate` button needs to remove saved articles from DB after confirming with user, "Clear All Articles from Library?"

* Create `ORM.js` file to act as go-between for routes and MongoDB

* Create `utils.js` for routes to access additional functions e.g. scrape

* Comments will add additional comments and not replace existing
